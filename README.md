# A-recursive-version-of-tic-tac-toe
The goal in this assignment is to implement a recursive solution to playing Tic-tac-toe perfectly.

I used ChatGPT to generate the given python code, where the computer plays Tic-tac-toe against a human, making random moves. Your task is to add the necessary code  (changing function "computer_turn", so that the computer plays perfectly.

Interesting fact: the comment in function "computer_turn" was generated by ChatGPT, so I guess, our class wins !!

For a delivery you can upload your changed source code file  (change the given one), and if you wish, a short report.
